For our project Tech, the intention is that we eventually make a dating app together with a project group. The first part of the project is completely individual. You come up with a feature for a dating app and work it out. At the end of the project, you only combine all the features of everyone into one app. And that app is called: DateIT.

Take a look at our process in the [Wiki](https://github.com/ralfz123/dating-app-feature/wiki).
# :heart: What is DateIT?
In **DateIT** you can create an account and like users. When there is a match between you and the other user, it appears on the matchlist.

# :heart_eyes: Jobstories
_When I'm looking for a serious connection with someone,  
_I would like to create a personal account,  
_so that others can find me .___  

_When I sign up with a dating app,  
_I want to be able to register or log in quickly and easily,  
_so I can start searching singles right away.___  

_When I'm logged into the dating app,  
_I want to be able to like other users,  
_so that (maybe) eventually a match will come.___
